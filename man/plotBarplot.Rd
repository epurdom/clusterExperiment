\arguments{
\item{object}{A matrix of with each column corresponding to a clustering and
each row a sample or a \code{\link{ClusterExperiment}} object.}

\item{whichClusters}{argument that can be either numeric or character vector
indicating the clusterings to be used. See details of \code{\link{getClusterIndex}}.}

\item{labels}{if object is a ClusterExperiment object, then labels defines 
whether the clusters will be identified by their names values in 
clusterLegend (labels="names", the default) or by their clusterIds value in
clusterLegend (labels="ids").}

\item{...}{for \code{plotBarplot} arguments passed either to the method of
\code{plotBarplot} for matrices or ultimately to \code{\link{barplot}}.}

\item{xNames}{names for the clusters on x-axis (i.e. clustering given 1st). 
By default uses names of the 1st column of clusters matrix. See details.}

\item{legNames}{names for the clusters dividing up the 1st clusters (will 
appear in legend). By default uses names of the 2nd cluster of clusters
matrix. If only one clustering, \code{xNames} and \code{legNames} refer to
the same clustering. See details.}

\item{legend}{whether to plot the legend}

\item{xlab}{label for x-axis. By default or if equal NULL the column name of 
the 1st cluster of clusters matrix}

\item{legend.title}{label for legend. By default or if equal NULL the column 
name of the 2st cluster of clusters matrix}

\item{unassignedColor}{If ``-1'' in \code{clusters}, will be given this color
(meant for samples not assigned to cluster).}

\item{missingColor}{If ``-2'' in clusters, will be given this color (meant
for samples that were missing from the clustering, mainly when comparing
clusterings run on different sets of samples)}

\item{colPalette}{a vector of colors used for the different clusters. See
details.}
}
\value{
A plot is produced, nothing is returned
}
\description{
Make a barplot of sample's assignments to clusters for single clustering, or 
cross comparison for two clusterings.
}
\details{
The first column of the cluster matrix will be on the x-axis and the
  second column (if present) will separate the groups of the first column.

All arguments of the matrix version can be passed to the 
  \code{ClusterExperiment} version. As noted above, however, some arguments 
  have different interpretations.

If \code{whichClusters = "workflow"}, then the most recent two 
  clusters of the workflow will be chosen where recent is based on the 
  following order (most recent first): final, mergeClusters, makeConsensus, 
  clusterMany.

\code{xNames}, \code{legNames} and \code{colPalette} should all be
  named vectors, with the names referring to the clusters they should match
  to (for \code{ClusterExperiment} objects, it is determined by the argument
  \code{labels} as to whether the names should match the cluster names or the
  clusterIds). \code{colPalette} and \code{legNames} must be same length of
  the number of clusters found in the second clustering, or if  only a single
  clustering, the same length as the number of clusters in that clustering.

#clustering using pam: try using different dimensions of pca and different k
data(simData)
