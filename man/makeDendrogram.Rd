\arguments{
\item{x}{data to define the medoids from. Matrix and
\code{\link{ClusterExperiment}} supported.}

\item{whichCluster}{argument that can be a single numeric or character value
indicating the \emph{single} clustering to be used. Giving values that result in more than one clustering will result in an error. See details of \code{\link{getClusterIndex}}.}

\item{reduceMethod}{character A character identifying what type of
dimensionality reduction to perform before clustering. Can be either a
value stored in either of reducedDims or filterStats slot or a built-in
diminsionality reduction/filtering. The option "coCluster" will use the
co-Clustering matrix stored in the 'coClustering' slot of the
\code{ClusterExperiment} object}

\item{nDims}{The number of dimensions to keep from \code{reduceMethod}. If
missing calls \code{\link{defaultNDims}}.}

\item{unassignedSamples}{how to handle unassigned samples("-1") ; only
relevant for sample clustering. See details.}

\item{...}{for makeDendrogram, if signature \code{matrix}, arguments passed
to hclust; if signature \code{ClusterExperiment} passed to the method for
signature \code{matrix}. For plotDendrogram, passed to
\code{\link{plot.dendrogram}}.}

\item{cluster}{A numeric vector with cluster assignments. If x is a
ClusterExperiment object, cluster is automatically the primaryCluster(x).
``-1'' indicates the sample was not assigned to a cluster.}

\item{calculateSample}{only relevant for \code{matrix} or \code{dist}
version of function. Indicates whether to calculate the sample dendrogram.}
}
\value{
If x is a matrix, a list with two dendrograms, one in which the
  leaves are clusters and one in which the leaves are samples. If x is a
  ClusterExperiment object, the dendrograms are saved in the appropriate
  slots.
}
\description{
Makes a dendrogram of a set of clusters based on hclust on the
  medoids of the cluster.
}
\details{
The function returns two dendrograms (as a list if x is a matrix or
  in the appropriate slots if x is ClusterExperiment). The cluster dendrogram
  is created by applying \code{\link{hclust}} to the medoids of each cluster.
  In the sample dendrogram the clusters are again clustered, but now the
  samples are also part of the resulting dendrogram. This is done by giving
  each sample the value of the medoid of its cluster.

The argument \code{unassignedSamples} governs what is done with
  unassigned samples (defined by a -1 cluster value). If
  unassigned=="cluster", then the dendrogram is created by hclust of the
  expanded medoid data plus the original unclustered observations. If
  \code{unassignedSamples} is "outgroup", then all unassigned samples are put
  as an outgroup. If the \code{x} object is a matrix, then
  \code{unassignedSamples} can also be "remove", to indicate that samples
  with "-1" should be discarded. This is not a permitted option, however,
  when \code{x} is a \code{ClusterExperiment} object, because it would return
  a dendrogram with less samples than \code{NCOL(x)}, which is not permitted
  for the \code{@dendro_samples} slot.

If any merge information is stored in the input object, it will be
  erased by a call to makeDendrogram.
