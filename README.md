## Installation instructions

### Installation From Bioconductor

We recommend installation of the package via bioconductor.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("clusterExperiment")
```

To install the most recent version of the package available on the development branch of bioconductor, follow the above instructions, after downloading the development version of bioconductor (see  [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/) for instructions).

### Installation of Github Version:

We generally try to keep the bioconductor *devel* version up-to-date with the *master* branch of this git repository. But since this can require installing R and/or bioconductor development version, it can be convenient to be able to get just the most recent version from github. 

You can install the github version via

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("epurdom/clusterExperiment")
```

### Development branch:

The `develop` branch is our development branch where we are actively updating features, and may contain bugs or be in the process of being updated. You should not use the `develop` branch unless it passes TravisCI checks (see below) and you want to be using a *very* beta version.

The development branch can be installed via the `install_github` command above, but indicating the `develop` branch:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("epurdom/clusterExperiment", ref="develop")
```
