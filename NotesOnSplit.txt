* Need to deal with plotReducedDims -- should it stay in ClusterExperiment, or move with reduceDims stuff?
* Should contrasts for clusters be in clusterExperiment?
* need a constructor function that will add RSEC info to ClusterExperiment object. 
* Need to create data object that is ClusterExperiment object. Currently examples run clusterSingle/clusterMany to create it. 
--> Could just use the setup objects for testing -- that way don't have to replicate as much code between packages...
* Not sure why suggests Rtsne

* testing:
-- hdf5 setup using filterStats/ReducedDims for constructing object -- For now commenting out, but need to test clusterExperiment compatibility. 

* makeDendrogram:
-- made simplified version for clusterExperiment object that uses *entire* assay (based on whichAssay), instead of doing reduced dimensions. But running on *entire* assay seems problematic. 

* plotHeatmap similar problems with disentangle from reducedDims.
