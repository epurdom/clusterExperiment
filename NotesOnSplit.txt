* Should contrasts for clusters be in clusterExperiment?
* need a constructor function that will add RSEC info to ClusterExperiment object. 
* Need to create data object that is ClusterExperiment object. Currently examples run clusterSingle/clusterMany to create it. 
--> Could just use the setup objects for testing -- that way don't have to replicate as much code between packages...
* Not sure why package suggests Rtsne -- vignette?
* source("setup_create_objects.R") takes a surprisingly long time -- hdf problem. 


Existing problems (FIXME):

* Problem with dataGeneration that uses RSECPackage -- will create class of RSECClass and not a CE. Need to fix
* makedendrogram not working where relies on reduce (dependence on coClustering...)
* plotdendrogram not working bc relies on merge.

Tests working (clusterExperiment):
* test-constructor
