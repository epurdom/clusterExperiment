* Need to deal with plotReducedDims -- should it stay in ClusterExperiment, or move with reduceDims stuff?
* Should contrasts for clusters be in clusterExperiment?
* need a constructor function that will add RSEC info to ClusterExperiment object. 
* Need to create data object that is ClusterExperiment object. Currently examples run clusterSingle/clusterMany to create it. 
--> Could just use the setup objects for testing -- that way don't have to replicate as much code between packages...
* Not sure why suggests Rtsne

* testing:
-- hdf5 setup using filterStats/ReducedDims for constructing object -- maybe don't need for clusterExperiment?? For now commenting out.

* makeDendrogram:
Need to move merge stuff to RSEC:
Error in mergeClusterIndex(x) : 
  could not find function "mergeClusterIndex"

Error in wanting to do reduced dims... uses getReducedData
