* Should contrasts for clusters be in clusterExperiment?
* need a constructor function that will add RSEC info to ClusterExperiment object. 
* Need to create data object that is ClusterExperiment object. Currently examples run clusterSingle/clusterMany to create it. 
--> Could just use the setup objects for testing -- that way don't have to replicate as much code between packages...
* Not sure why package suggests Rtsne -- vignette?
* source("setup_create_objects.R") takes a surprisingly long time -- hdf problem. 


Existing problems (FIXME):

* Problem with dataGeneration that uses RSECPackage -- will create class of RSECClass and not a CE. Need to fix; requires RSECPackage to have option that removes the unused parts of ClusterExperiment...
* plotHeatmap and plotContrastHeatmap have problems problems (test-assays and test-getBestFeatures)

Tests working (clusterExperiment):
* test-assays
* test-constructor
* test-dendrogram
* test-dimReduce
* test-getBestFeatures
* test-hdf5
* test-heatmaps (slowest!)
* test-otherPlots
* test-plotClusters
