* Should contrasts for clusters be in clusterExperiment?
* need a constructor function that will add RSEC info to ClusterExperiment object. 
* Need to create data object that is ClusterExperiment object. Currently examples run clusterSingle/clusterMany to create it. 
--> Could just use the setup objects for testing -- that way don't have to replicate as much code between packages...
* Not sure why package suggests Rtsne -- vignette?
* source("setup_create_objects.R") takes a surprisingly long time -- hdf problem. 


Existing problems (FIXME):

* Need a "as.ClusterExperiment" function in RSECPackage to have option that removes the unused parts of ClusterExperiment (or is that built in??)
* vignette:
- When I do `plotBarplot` in vignette (plotBarplot(ceFluidigm,whichClusters=c("Published2" ,"Published1"))) not getting the colors correctly.
- Probably need a transformation in creating my clusterExperiment object. 
- Subsetting changing -1 values into cluster values! (vignette) Maybe because have name that isn't "-1"?

clusterMatrix(smallCe)
clusterMatrix(ceFluidigm)[1:10,]

Tests working (clusterExperiment):
* test-assays
* test-constructor
* test-dendrogram
* test-dimReduce
* test-getBestFeatures
* test-hdf5
* test-heatmaps (slowest!)
* test-otherPlots
* test-plotClusters
